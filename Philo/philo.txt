first create a minimal program that hadnles threading and mutex

Subject consists of an N number of philosophers, each philosopher has their own fork, but when eating they use their fork and the fork on their right. 
when one philosopher eat, N-1 don't eat.

each philo is a seperate thread
protect each fork's state with a mutex

theres a time to die for each philo, each one needs to start eating within that time or else they die. 

thers time to eat, each philo has a time to eat, and finish eating. During that time they will use thei fork and the one next to them

time to sleep, the time a philo will spend sleeping

another argument how many times philos need to eat to stop sim.

theres three states: eating thinking or sleeping


if i have 3 philos for example:

1 --- 2 --- 3

each takes 10 to eat and 50 to die and 20 to sleep

so: ./philo 3 50 10 20

1 -- 2 -- 3
if 1 is eating -- 50 - 10
2 is sleeping -- 50 - 20
3 is thinking -- 50 - 10 - 20

1 is sleeping -- 50 - 20
2 is thinking -- 50 - 10
3 is eating -- 50 - 20

eating->sleeping->thinking->eating
